# Arduino-Raspi-Serial-Communication

<img src="docs/overview-diagram.jpg" width="600">

Using serial communication to send data from an Arduino to a Raspberry Pi. The application in this project uses the Arduino
as a transmitting device that reads a switch configuration set by the user. The configuration is interpreted as a binary
number, and is sent to the Raspberry Pi where it lights the LEDs according to the switch configuration.
